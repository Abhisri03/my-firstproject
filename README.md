 WASTE.WISE (WASTE MATERIAL DETECTOR )
The Waste Material Detector is an AI-powered web and mobile application that identifies different types of waste materials from images and provides smart recycling or upcycling suggestions. By simply snapping a photo, users can discover creative and sustainable ways to reuse or recycle their waste. This project aims to promote environmental awareness and simplify waste management through the use of artificial intelligence.
